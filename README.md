# THREADBORN — सुत्रजात

A full-colour **webtoon manga**, written chapter by chapter, page by page, with images — designed
from the first page to become a **trading card game** once the cast passes 500 chapters.

> This is a **from-scratch rewrite.** The earlier AI-generated site (analysed in
> [`ringbound-era-analysis.md`](ringbound-era-analysis.md)) was scrapped: its 120 "chapters" were one
> five-scene template with names swapped in. This repo builds the story properly.

**Format:** webtoon, vertical scroll, full colour · **Languages:** English + Hindi (Devanagari)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Series** | THREADBORN (सुत्रजात) |
| **Branch** | `arena/01a0b2c8-manga` (the only branch we work on — each Arena session gets a fresh one; keep this field current) |
| **Chapter in progress** | **001** — *The Girl With No Thread* |
| **Pages completed** | **001**, **002**, **003** |
| **NEXT page to build** | **004** |
| **Open PR** | [Kyabtao/Manga#2](https://github.com/Kyabtao/Manga/pull/2) (targets `main`; PR #1 is merged) |

### Next-page brief (Chapter 001 · Page 004)
Ira speaks to an official for the **first time** in the series — short, practical, unimpressed.
Rekhak delivers the errand as an *offer*: come up-terrace and meet the person who wants her, or the
Council "corrects the ledger" and unregisters her entirely (legal erasure — worse than arrest, because
an unregistered null has no rights at all). Kessa forbids her to go, then in the same breath sells her
something that will help if she does — contradictory, and that is the point. End on Ira flipping the
appraisal back onto the auditor with the one question Sight can't answer: *"What do you owe,
Reckoner?"* — and let the hairline crack under his left eye tighten as the Loom hums through his
answer. Keep the crimson buyer unnamed. Keep the sewer a locked box.

### Format decisions (user-confirmed — do not relitigate)
- Fresh world (NOT the old Aetherra) · webtoon full colour · vertical strip · English + Hindi.

# 🔁 HOW TO RESUME IN A NEW CHAT (step by step)

1. Read this README (especially **CURRENT POSITION**).
2. Read the canon: `series-bible/00-overview.md`, `02-power-system.md`, `style-guide.md`.
3. Read the previous page's script + its `characters/` and `other/` notes so continuity holds
   (e.g. `chapters/chapter-001/story/page-002.md`).
4. Build the **next page** using the Workflow below.
5. **Update CURRENT POSITION** above (pages completed + next-page brief).
6. Commit to the session branch named in CURRENT POSITION, push, and open/refresh the PR (see Git rules).

### Git rules
- Work only on the branch named in **CURRENT POSITION** (each Arena session gets a fresh
  `arena/…-manga` branch; update the field when it changes). Commit, then
  `git push origin <that branch>`.
- One PR per branch. A merged PR does not follow a new branch: when the session branch changes, open a
  new PR from it (currently [PR #2](https://github.com/Kyabtao/Manga/pull/2); PR #1 is merged). After
  pushing, the open PR updates automatically — do **not** open a second PR from the same branch.
- If the local clone looks fresh (HEAD at "Initial commit", files untracked), that is expected in a
  new sandbox: `git add -A && git commit && git push` and the PR will pick everything up.

# 📖 STORY SO FAR (one line per page)

- **Page 001** — At the Unspooling, humankin thread-mender **Ira Sutar** draws **no thread**; the hook
  reveals an old surgical **stitch** sewn across her empty palm.
- **Page 002** — Kessa the Kshudra debt-appraiser reads Ira's palm: **zero debt**. Thesis lands:
  *"You're the only dry thing in the flood. That is not a defect. That is a price."* Hook: *"Who sewed you?"*
- **Page 003** — Kessa explains what a stitch *is* (a door nailed shut before it could open — Ira's
  thread was **hidden**, not missing) but never *who* sewed it. Then the market goes cold: **Rekhak
  Vahni**, Ash Council Debt-Reckoner, descends the Council Stair hunting "a hole" in the ledger — the
  girl the Court recorded but the Council never registered. Hook: he asks for **Ira Sutar** by name.

# 🗂️ STRUCTURE

```
series-bible/            The canon. Read before writing anything.
  00-overview.md         Pitch, why it scales, why it becomes a card game
  01-the-nine-kinds.md   Races (human → demon, elf → goblin, humankin…), each with an art direction
  02-power-system.md     The Sutra, Debt, Fraying, Mending — the rules, and the rules that are banned
  03-the-nine-sectors.md Regions, each with a different law of pulling
  04-card-game-notes.md  The TCG design, carried forward from Chapter 1
  style-guide.md         Art direction + reusable image-prompt block

chapters/
  chapter-001/
    story/     page-001..003 .md / .hi.md            (scripts EN + Hindi)
    characters/ ira-sutar.md, kessa.md, rekhak-vahni.md,
                cast-page-001..003.md, *-ref.png
    other/     locations.md, glossary.md
    images/    page-001.png, page-002.png, page-003.png
```

Every chapter follows the same `story/ characters/ other/ images/` layout.

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW (how each page is made)

1. **Script** — write `story/page-NNN.md` in English.
2. **Translate** — mirror it in `story/page-NNN.hi.md`.
3. **Cast** — log every character in `characters/`, with a card-game line.
4. **World** — log places & terms in `other/`.
5. **Art** — render `images/page-NNN.png` from `style-guide.md`'s prompt block.
6. **Track** — update this README's CURRENT POSITION; commit; push; refresh PR.
